Music Explorer is a free tool to learn about the nature of music in a visual way. It can also be used by musicians to help transcribe recorded music by identifying hard-to-hear chords. 

It allows you to visually identify which notes are being played in a clip of music and instantly see how music is made up of many overtones.

It uses the standard SMPTE time format to quickly select a certain part of a sound file to play and analyze. (SMPTE is made up of Hours::Minutes::Seconds::Frames where Frames range from 0 to 29.)

It also allows pitches to be identified by clicking on the piano keyboard, and an appropriate sine wave will be played.

This is free software. Source code is available for C++/MFC, and can be used in projects licensed under the GNU Public License. The source code would be useful for anyone trying to write a waveform analyzer, sound player, or interactive piano keyboard.

Notes about compiling music explorer:

In visual studio, go into Options and set the include
directories to include the app, common, fftw, and rfftw 
directories.

Have fun!
